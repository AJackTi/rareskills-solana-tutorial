# Day 3: Solana Anchor Program IDL

[Day 3](https://www.rareskills.io/post/anchor-idl) of [RareSkills Solana Course](https://www.rareskills.io/solana-tutorial).

## Setup

1. Replace your keypair in file `Anchor.toml`

- If you don't know how to config it. [Read here](https://solana.com/developers/guides/getstarted/setup-local-development)
- After setting it up successfully, check the path with:

```bash
echo "/Users/$USER/.config/solana/id.json"
```

- Replace the result in the file `Anchor.toml` like below:

```
  [provider]
  cluster = "Devnet"
  wallet = "/Users/ajackti/.config/solana/id.json"
```

2. Build Anchor program: `anchor build`
3. Sync program_id with Anchor key: `anchor keys sync`
4. Run tests: `anchor test`

> **Note:** `anchor build` only affects `lib.rs` file.
>
> To test the `IDL` output of `non-empty-account.rs`, replace the contents of `lib.rs` with the contents from `non-empty-account.rs`.

## Notes

- The `Interface Definition Language (IDL)` is a JSON file that describes how to interact with a `Solana program`.
- The `IDL` is automatically generated by the `Anchor framework`.
- An `IDL` file in Solana is similar to an `ABI` file in `Solidity`.
- Rust functions are `snake_cased`, but Anchor formats the functions to `camelCased` for JavaScript.
- `Initialize` is the default naming of the struct by Anchor, but you can rename it.
- `#[derive(Accounts)]` adds accounts from the struct to the `IDL accounts key`.
